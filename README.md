# LyricsOnDemand
LyricsOnDemand is from a personal school project in which we were required to take two API's ( any form of Auth ), and make them work together with one another. I personally chose to use Google Drive API with OAuth 2.0 requirements paired with lyricsovh API

The user is first asked to login to their Google Drive account, and is then asked to enter a Song Title paired with the songs Artist. The client then creates a new document in the users Google Drive account with the Song Title , and appropriate lyrics for the song inside of the document.
